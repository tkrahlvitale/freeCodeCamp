          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

          CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.

          Before starting this module, you should have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Basic familiarity with using computers and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)
          </li>
          <li>
            A basic work environment set up and an understanding of how to create and manage files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Basic familiarity with HTML.
          </li>
        </ul>

          CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
        </p>
        <code class="code-example">
          h1 {<br>color: red;<br>font-size: 5em;<br>}
        </code>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1).
          </li>
          <li>
            We then have a set of curly braces <code>{ }</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (<code>color</code> in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the property after the colon (<code>red</code> in this example).
          </li>
          <li>
            This example contains two declarations, one for <code>color</code> and the other for <code>font-size</code>. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value that we'd like to give the property.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <code>styles.css</code>. The <code>.css</code> extension shows that this is a CSS file.
          </p>
          <p>
            To link styles.css to index.html, add the following line somewhere inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the HTML document:
          </p>
          <code class="code-example">
            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
          </code>
          <p>
            This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor, add the following to your CSS file:
          </p>
          <p>
            An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&gt;.
